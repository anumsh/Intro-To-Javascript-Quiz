Quiz-1
Write a while loop that:

Loop through the numbers 1 to 20
If the number is divisible by 3, print "Julia"
If the number is divisible by 5, print "James"
If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "JuliaJames"
If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, print the number

Code:

var x = 1;

while (x <=20) {
    if (x%3 === 0 && x%5 === 0) {
        console.log("JuliaJames");
    }
    else if (x%5 === 0) {
        console.log("James");
    }
    else if (x%3 === 0){
        console.log("Julia");
    }
    else {
        console.log(x);
    }
    x=x+1;
    }

Output:
1
2
Julia
4
James

Quiz-2
Write a loop that prints out the following song. Starting at 99, and ending at 1 bottle.

99 bottles of juice on the wall! 99 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 98 bottles of juice on the wall!
98 bottles of juice on the wall! 98 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 97 bottles of juice on the wall!
...
2 bottles of juice on the wall! 2 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 1 bottle of juice on the wall!
1 bottle of juice on the wall! 1 bottle of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 0 bottles of juice on the wall!

Code:
 var num = 99;

while (num >=0) {
       if  (num > 2) {
           sub=num - 1;
           console.log(num +" bottles of juice on the wall! " + num+ " bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... "+ sub + " bottles of juice on the wall!");
       }
        else if (num == 2){
            sub=num - 1;
           console.log(num +" bottles of juice on the wall! " + num+ " bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... "+ sub + " bottle of juice on the wall!");
        }
        else if (num === 1) {
            sub=num - 1;
           console.log(num +" bottle of juice on the wall! " + num+ " bottle of juice! Take one down, pass it around... "+ sub + " bottles of juice on the wall!");
        }
           num = num - 1;
    }

Quiz-3
Rewrite the following while loop as a for loop:

var x = 9;
while (x >= 1) {
  console.log("hello " + x);
  x = x - 1;
}

Code:
for(var x=9; x>=1; x=x-1)  {
    console.log("hello " + x);
}

Output:
hello 9
hello 8
hello 7
hello 6
hello 5
hello 4
hello 3
hello 2
hello 1


Quiz-4
Write a for loop that prints out the factorial of the number 12:

A factorial is calculated by multiplying a number by all the numbers below it. For instance, 3! or "3 factorial" is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6

Code:

var solution=1;
for( var x=1;x<=12;x++)
{
    solution=solution*x;

}
console.log(solution);

Output:
479001600

Quiz-5
Theater seats often display a row and seat number to help theatergoers find their seats.
If there are 26 rows (0 to 25) and 100 seats (0 to 99) in each row, write a nested for
loop to print out all of the different seat combinations in the theater.

Code:
var row;
var seat;
for (row = 0; row <= 25; row++){
for (seat = 0; seat <= 99; seat++){
console.log(row + "-" + seat);
}
}


Quiz-6
Here is a for loop that's supposed to print the numbers 5 through 9. Fix the error!

for (x < 10; x++) {
  console.log(x);
}

Code:

for (var x=5; x < 10; x++) {
    console.log(x);
}

Quiz-7
The for loop below has an error. Fix it!

for (var k = 0 k < 200 k++) {
  console.log(k);
}

Code:
for (var k = 0; k < 200; k++) {
    console.log(k);
}
