Quiz-1
Write a while loop that:

Loop through the numbers 1 to 20
If the number is divisible by 3, print "Julia"
If the number is divisible by 5, print "James"
If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "JuliaJames"
If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, print the number

Code:

var x = 1;

while (x<=20) {
    // check divisibility
    // print Julia, James, or JuliaJames
    // increment x
var output = x%3==0 ? (x%5==0 ? "JuliaJames" : "Julia") : (x%5==0 ? "James" : x);
console.log(output);    
x++;
}

Output:
1
2
Julia
4
James
Julia
7
8
Julia
James
11
Julia
13
14
JuliaJames
16
17
Julia
19
James

Quiz-2
Write a loop that prints out the following song. Starting at 99, and ending at 1 bottle.

99 bottles of juice on the wall! 99 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 98 bottles of juice on the wall!
98 bottles of juice on the wall! 98 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 97 bottles of juice on the wall!
...
2 bottles of juice on the wall! 2 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 1 bottle of juice on the wall!
1 bottle of juice on the wall! 1 bottle of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 0 bottles of juice on the wall!

Code:
var num = 99;
while (num>=1) {
    // check value of num
    // print lyrics using num
    // don't forget to check pluralization on the last line!
    // decrement num
    var bottle = num >= 2 ? "bottles" : "bottle";
    var output= num +" "+ bottle + " of juice on the wall! " + num + " "+  bottle + " of juice! Take one down, pass it around... " + (num= num-1)+ " " ;
    var bot= num==1? "bottle" : "bottles";
    output += bot +" of juice on the wall!";
    console.log(output);
}

Quiz-3
NASA's countdown to launch includes checkpoints where NASA engineers complete certain technical tasks. During the final minute, NASA has 6 tasks to complete:

Orbiter transfers from ground to internal power (T-50 seconds)
Ground launch sequencer is go for auto sequence start (T-31 seconds)
Activate launch pad sound suppression system (T-16 seconds)
Activate main engine hydrogen burnoff system (T-10 seconds)
Main engine start (T-6 seconds)
Solid rocket booster ignition and liftoff! (T-0 seconds)

code:
time=60;
while(time >=0){
    switch (time) {
     case 50:
         console.log("Orbiter transfers from ground to internal power");
         break;
     case 31:
         console.log("Ground launch sequencer is go for auto sequence start");
         break;
     case 16:
         console.log("Activate launch pad sound suppression system");
         break;
     case 10:
         console.log("Activate main engine hydrogen burnoff system");
         break;
     case 6:
         console.log("Main engine start");
         break;
     case 0:
         console.log("Solid rocket booster ignition and liftoff!");
         break;
     default:
         console.log("T-"+time + " seconds");
    }
    time--;
}

Quiz-4
Rewrite the following while loop as a for loop:

var x = 9;
while (x >= 1) {
  console.log("hello " + x);
  x = x - 1;
}

Code:
for(var x=9; x>=1; x=x-1)  {
    console.log("hello " + x);
}

Output:
hello 9
hello 8
hello 7
hello 6
hello 5
hello 4
hello 3
hello 2
hello 1


Quiz-5
Write a for loop that prints out the factorial of the number 12:

A factorial is calculated by multiplying a number by all the numbers below it. For instance, 3! or "3 factorial" is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6

Code:

var solution=1;
for( var x=1;x<=12;x++)
{
    solution=solution*x;

}
console.log(solution);

Output:
479001600

Quiz-6
Theater seats often display a row and seat number to help theatergoers find their seats.
If there are 26 rows (0 to 25) and 100 seats (0 to 99) in each row, write a nested for
loop to print out all of the different seat combinations in the theater.

Code:
var row;
var seat;
for (row = 0; row <= 25; row++){
for (seat = 0; seat <= 99; seat++){
console.log(row + "-" + seat);
}
}


Quiz-7
Here is a for loop that's supposed to print the numbers 5 through 9. Fix the error!

for (x < 10; x++) {
  console.log(x);
}

Code:

for (var x=5; x < 10; x++) {
    console.log(x);
}

Quiz-8
The for loop below has an error. Fix it!

for (var k = 0 k < 200 k++) {
  console.log(k);
}

Code:
for (var k = 0; k < 200; k++) {
    console.log(k);
}
